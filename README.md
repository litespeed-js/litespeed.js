Litespeed.js is a micro Javascript framework for building simple web applications. Litespeed.js is dependency-free and **easy to learn** framework which allows you to extend your DOM functionality in a semantic and declarative way.

The litespeed.js framework main features include an **[MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)** architecture, built-in single page **routing**, easy to build **view components**, **dependency injection** service, **data binding**, and fully **valid and accessible HTML and DOM**.

Litespeed.js makes very good use of both browser memory management, garbage collection and rendering to maximize your web application performance. As of version 0.2.* litespeed.js weights only **4.9kb (minified and compressed)**
